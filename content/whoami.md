Hello there.

I'm **Ted Mathew dela Cruz**, a software developer at [Bukas](https://bukas.ph). We help Filipino and Indonesian youth attain higher education through student loans.

I'm also a white-hat, independent cybersecurity researcher. I _legally_ hack corporations with their permission during my free time. Companies have rewarded me for finding vulnerabilities in their assets through the HackerOne bug bounty platform.

I also tinker with AI to empower small teams in their workflow.
