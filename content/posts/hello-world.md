This is a new space for me to write about tech. Thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) I'm able set to this up without spending a single dollar. 

I'm working on so lots stuff -- hunting security vulnerabilities (and hopefully get paid for it) on [Hackerone](https://www.hackerone.com/) and [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/), learning Go for my tooling, honing my shell scripting skillz, and modding my mechanical keyboards.

I'll write about these soon!
